# springboot-ba
Project QA Alina Ard.


Aim of the project is to develop an application spring boot that will allow to a company of health care to automatically register patient.

Project scope

•	Code fully integrated into a Version Control System using the feature-branch model: main/dev/multiple features. 
•	A project management board with full expansion on user stories, acceptance criteria and tasks needed to complete the project. 
•	A risk assessment which outlines the issues and risks faced during the project timeframe. 
Functional requirements

Functional requirement are as follows:

•	To create a database in MySQL Workbench
•	an application back-end developed using the language from your Programming Fundamentals module (e.g. Java)
•	a means of making API calls (Postman)
•	to view, delete, update database

Non-functional requirements

•	Scalability
•	Maintainability
•	Workability

Software methodology

Agile

In software development, agile (sometimes written Agile) practices include requirements discovery and solutions improvement through the collaborative effort of self-organizing and cross-functional teams with their customer(s)/end user(s), adaptive planning, evolutionary development, early delivery, continual improvement, and flexible responses to changes in requirements, capacity, and understanding of the problems to be solved. (wikipedia.org, 2021)


IntelliJ IDEA

“IntelliJ IDEA is an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) for JVM languages designed to maximize developer productivity. It does the routine and repetitive tasks for you by providing clever code completion, static code analysis, and refactoring’s, and lets you focus on the bright side of software development, making it not only productive but also an enjoyable experience.” (jetbrains.com, 2021)

Challenges

The most challenging subjects for me was:
•	Time: because I have busy schedule
•	The novelty of Java and all types of tools
•	The QA experience was interesting 

The project contains many constrains such as:
•	Version Control System: Git 
•	Source Code Management: GitHub 
•	Kanban Board: Jira (Scrum Board) 
•	Database Management System: H2 or MySQL Server (local or GCP) 
•	Back-End Programming Language: Java 
•	API Development Platform: Spring  
•	Build Tool: Maven 

•	Unit & Integration testing: JUnit 




Issues in project

Issues that I encountered was:
•	To code in Eclipse IDE was a difficult part for me so I selected In IntelliJ IDEA, which is very intuitive, very smart, integrate all type of tools, very easy to learn.
•	the testing part that I could not understood properly.


Future improvements

•	Use custom queries, such as ‘find by name’. 
•	Develop custom exceptions in your service. 
•	Include the use of DTOs 
•	Include the use of Lombok 
•	Implement Mockito
